# Set default behavior to automatically normalize line endings
# When text is set to "auto", the path is marked for automatic end-of-line conversion.
# If Git decides that the content is text, its line endings are converted to LF on checkin.
# When the file has been committed with CRLF, no conversion is done.
 
*   text=auto
 
# 'text' attribute enables and controls end-of-line normalization.
# When a text file is normalized, its line endings are converted to LF in the repository.
# The attribute 'diff' affects how Git generates diffs for particular files.
# It can tell Git whether to generate a textual patch for the path or to treat the path as a binary file
# 'python' is built in pattern that is suitable for source code in the Python language.
